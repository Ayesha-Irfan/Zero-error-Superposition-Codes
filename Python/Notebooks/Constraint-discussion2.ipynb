(Constraints 6., 7. and 10. together reduce the search space down to 7 variables, I think. Separately, 11. would reduce the search space by 6 variables. In the best case, if these constraints were independent, together, they'd reduce the search space down to one variable, but there are almost certainly dependencies. To find these dependencies, run Gaussian elimination on the $p_{C,C',X,X'}$ constraints to find the dimension of the corresponding affine space, and a basis for the solution space.)\n",
